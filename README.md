# AI-Driven-Cybersecurity-Threat-Prediction-Platform.
PROJECT STATEMENT:-

• The project aims to develop agentic AI that acts as tireless guardians of network security.

• These AI agents will autonomously monitor network traffic, detect anomalies, and respond to cyber threats in real time without constant human oversight.

• This approach could significantly enhance an organization's security posture and free up human experts to focus on more complex security challenges.

OUTCOMES:-

• Autonomous monitoring of network traffic for enhanced security.

• Real-time detection and response to cyber threats.

• Reduction in the workload of human security experts.

• Improved overall organizational resilience against digital threats.
